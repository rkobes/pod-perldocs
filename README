NAME
    Pod::Perldocs - view remote pod via Pod::Perldoc

DESCRIPTION
    This is a drop-in replacement for "perldoc" based on "Pod::Perldoc".
    Usage is the same, except in the case when documentation for a module
    cannot be found on the local machine, in which case a query (via LWP or
    SOAP::Lite) will be made to a remote pod repository and, if the
    documentation is found there, the results will be displayed as usual.

NOTE
    The values of $pod_server, $soap_uri and $soap_proxy at the top of 
    this script reflect the location of the remote pod repository.

SERVER
    See the *CPAN-Search-Lite* project on SourceForge at
    <http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpan-search/> for the software needed
    to set up a remote pod repository used by "perldocs".

SEE ALSO
    Pod::Perldoc.
